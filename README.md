Abstract. The aim of the project was to create an ecosystem for the younger generation - students and even adults who are concerned about their children's future.
Peer-to-peer technology is part of the solution and will be achieved by creating a currency dedicated to young people who are aware and prepared for tomorrow's economy.
The implementation of the currency will be done in The Binance Smart Chain Network, a secured blockchain contract that offers the possibility to execute commerce without the action of a financial institution or a third party.
